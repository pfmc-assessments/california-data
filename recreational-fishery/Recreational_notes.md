**April 2025 updates**
*Historical Regulations*
- For rockfishes there was a 15-fish bag limit in place at least as far back as 1997, and likely earlier than that.
- This 15-fish rockfish bag limit was within the California general daily bag limit of 20-fish per day.
- The first sub-bag limit for the rockfishes was a 3-fish limit for bocaccio implemented in 1998.



**Recreational Data Meeting November 16, 2022 Agenda**

*California Recreational Fisheries Surveys (CRFS) 101*
- Sampling Design
- Can someone at CDFW walk us through the basics? 
- Is sampling effort proportional to the spatial distribution of landings? 
  - CRFS is designed to estimate catch at the district and water area level (inside/outside 3nm)
  - Map sites (Melissa Monk - NOAA Federal)
-	How do you allocate effort within the strata?
  - PR = private/rental boats
  - PC = party/charter boats (aka CPFV)
  - PR1 example: for every site/day within 
  - PR1 20%; PR2 10% 
  -	PR1 are primary boats sites and conducted more like a census on sampling days
  -	PR2 are less active sites 
  -	PR2 only there for a portion of the day
  -	Kayak vs motorized vessel - boat types are flagged in the PR data
  -	# of site/day samples by district 
  -	Available number of sites * number of days is the site days; say district 1 and 4 would have a great number of site days available leading to more samples for these districts than districts that have fewer sites. 
  -	Uniform sampling rate by site
  -	CRFS - goal is to capture PR1 effort for every site
  -	Some sites have too little effort to sample
  - Will be checked every once and awhile for “checks”
- Length composition data and how to deal with weighting the catch
-	Might be important for weighting the comps in the stock assessments
-	E.J. and Jason Edwards working on methods for OR/WA
-	Follow up meeting with E.J. and Jason Edwards; will send email to Ashok and Laura, can add others as appropriate
-	Should we be concerned with including “man made” (MM)/”beach bank” (BB) modes in catch streams?
-	Excel file Laura has that documents when BB sampling stopped and data gaps
-	Length data available? Shore mode length data and weight data are sparse
-	Average weight data not available in most cases
-	If shore modes are a small % of landings, then differences in size composition will not have a large effect on assessment results
-	Length-weight relationships? Page 93 of the methods document
-	Weight- samplers taking weights as time allows
-	If many boats returning then the sampler will interview as many boats as possible; and prioritize that over biological data
-	2014 PSMFC calculated regression coefficients for weight-length samples

*COVID-19 CRFS impacts*
-	NO sampling between April 2020- June 2020; no biological sampling April 2020 through July 2021
-	Catch and effort estimates during this period
-	CPFV logs provide effort and that’s how CDFW estimates effort
-	Effort check comparing PC vessels and log submissions - to see if there’s non-compliance
-	Likely incomplete data
-	CRFS did not interview any anglers during April-June 2020
-	Groundfish project developed the proxy average values and used specifically during these times for inseason mgmt only; do not use as ‘official’ catch estimates
-	Catch streams for assessments?? Choice for assessments would be to use 0 or the proxy
-	Are there data we should not use; 
  -	When did onboard observing of the CPFVs return to “normal” and PR data
  -	Angler reported catch - higher proportion of rockfish genus and not speciated
  -	PR mode - April 2021 to August 2021 transition time when samplers were encouraged to get rockfish IDs again emphasized
  -	Laura will talk to CRFS leads
  -	Greater proportion of longer duration 
  -	CPFV onboard observing started in August 2021 again
  -	PR data - which years to exclude?
  -	Private boats: Private/Recreational1 vs PR2
  -	PR1 is 90% of the private/rental boat, PR1 survey is more of a census, samplers are there for a full day
  -	PR2 is 10% or less for catch of species in active management, sampling for PR2 within site/district is based on effort, directed towards higher effort sites; samplers are at the site for only a portion of the day

*CRFS Effort Estimation*
-	MRIP certification
-	Background - standards put in place in 2020;
-	MRIP process has not resulted in any changes to raw sample data or estimates   
End of meeting


**Recreational Data Meeting November 30, 2022 Agenda**
-	MRFSS data - will need to have a separate meeting with John B
  -	Any “gotchas”? E.g., change from total to fork length
  -	Jason Edwards making changes to MRFSS and CRFS
  -	Jason Cope circulated a document to solicit changes to RecFIN and issues - what we do on a regular basis
  -	Where is this documented?
  -	Have Jason Edwards present this to the group 
  -	He attended an assessment meeting and shared his todo list. May be able to locate this information in an assessment older meeting agenda.
  -	Check back in with JE to see where he is at in this work and how it may factor into the data for next year’s assessments
  -	Will the original data be retained? yes
  -	Total length to fork length, or conversions from weight to length
  -	Lengths were NOT calculated from weights in this dataset. This is a misunderstanding.
  -	T_LEN is total length and LNGTH is fork length (?)
  -	If length and weight are both decimals - Jason Edwards looking into
  - Stratification is at Point Conception and the Albin data helps here (see below)

*MRFSS*
-	B1 includes discards and unavailable dead fish - could have been retained 
-	Disposition could be used to parse out the B1 fish
-	Only weights they had were the retained fish - average weights of retained fished applied to B1 fish
-	E.J. - we’ve always used A+B1 for catches and that’s the recommendation going forward
-	Explain catch types in MRFSS, e.g., A, B1, etc. 
-	A fish are the observed fish
-	B1 is all angler reported a combination of discarded and unavailable dead fish. This includes a 100% discard mortality assumption.
-	Catch estimated in numbers and average weights applied - catch in biomass can be 0  missing values; pull in numbers and biomass
  -	Could fill in these missing values to assessors don’t miss them
-	MRFSS length data available by county (CNTY) and map these to districts used in CRFSS
-	MRFSS sampling was allocated based on catch and 
-	Redistribution of effort from SLO to the north (MRFSS era)
  -	Length data is available by county, and can therefore be aggregated in a way that closely approximates the district-level data in CRFS
  - Albin et al. used to allocate catch N/S of Point Conception (1980-1989)
- CRFS era; Applied a 0.42 discard mortality rate applied back in time - in CRFS error 2004-2008 this rate has been applied possibly - John B. will check on this

*Availability of any other CDFW otoliths from Andre Klein*
-	Refugia data from 1970s to 1980s
-	Will have an update in a few weeks - and will confirm age structure availability
  -	Copper - around 220 samples ranging in TL 100-570 mm
  - Black - 180 ranging in size TL 100-520 mm
  - Canary - 100 samples TL 100-510 mm

*Discard mortality and if/how that is applied by depths?*
-	Will the Council adopted discard mortality rates be applied? Starting when?
-	New rates will apply to discards for 2022 year and going forward
-	Laura - CFRS estimates are produced 6 weeks after the end of a month
-	CRFS estimates finalized in May-June of the next year
-	Copper data deadline is March 13 - STAT will prefer these by mid-April 
-	Prelim estimate by end of Feb might be possible
-	Will be applied to both PR and PC - dependent on if they said they used the descending device;
-	CRFS methods document has the discard mortality rates Appendix B

*Recreational regulations and time blocks - start the discussion?*
-	Adding Melanie Parker’s comment here: Can someone help describe what would be considered "major time blocks?" What do we do about the incremental changes to regulations over a period of 5-10 years that individually do not result in much change, but over time result in a significant change? What time blocks were used for prior assessments for these species?
-	Effort in the accepted practices to facilitate the GMT’s discussion of time blocks
  -	Mel Mandrup will be the GMT representative for STAR panel 1.
-	John B has an inventory of assessments and has info on what’s been done in the past
-	Melanie’s request - context for what is useful in the assessments and collaboration of looking
-	Bag limits may be important - switching of effort
-	Schedule this on the January GMT meeting?
