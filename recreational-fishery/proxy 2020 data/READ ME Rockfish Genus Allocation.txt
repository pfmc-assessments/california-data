California recreational total mortality estimates in the "rockfish genus" were inflated during the Covid pandemic due to CRFS samplers being unable to closely examine catch and identify it to species.  This was a problem for the "party/charter boat (PC)" and "private/rental (PR)" modes in 2020 and primarily for the PC mode in 2021.  An effort was made to allocate some of the rockfish genus mortality to other rockfish species for these modes and years.  An expected value of rockfish genus mortality in 2020 and 2021 was generated by mode and year according to the average proportion to the total rockfish mortality this category represented in 2018 and 2019, when regulations were consistent with 2020 and 2021.  Mortality above this expected value was attributed to the other species also based on proportions each species represented to the total from 2018 and 2019.  Calculations were made by year, mode, and district.  The shore-based modes were grouped in with the PR mode.  Calculations were initially made in numbers of fish because rockfish genus mortality is only recorded this way.  Numbers of fish by species were then converted to weight in kilograms based on average weights of fish recorded by the CRFS program by district in 2019.  Original and allocated values are posted in the genus_allocate.csv table.
