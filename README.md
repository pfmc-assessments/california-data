# california-data
The repository developed in 2022 in preparation for the 2023 stock assessment cycle, out of conversations between National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) stock assessment scientists and California Department of Fish and Widlife (CDFW) staff to improve the understanding of CDFW data for stock assessments.  The repo was migrated from a GDrive ccount in Dec 2022.  The POCs for NMFS and CDFW for the 2023 cycle remain in the GDrive. 


**Creating a GitHub Account and Additional Resources**
- Unless you plan to be running models, helping write the document, you will only need a GitHub account
- To create an account visit Github.com in any browser
- We will utilize [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/quickstart) for data questions, thoughts, suggestions, show and tell, etc.
- If there is topic in the discussions that we come to a consensus on, we can move it to an Issue that will result in changes to the code or datastreams
- Discussions allow us to keep the process more transparents and maintain a record for the next cycle or person who works with the data
- No raw data will typically be stored on GitHub, just the tools to analyze data (unless we include an example in a package)


**Stock Assessment Documents**
- Stock Assessment documents are written in R Markdown and live on GitHub
- If you plan on helping with document writing, you could either write sections and share them as a text file, use the VS Code editor on the web, or familiarize yourself with GitHub and coordinate among STAT members

**Stock Assessment Modeling**
- The new [unofficial stock assessment handbook](https://pfmc-assessments.github.io/pfmc_assessment_handbook/) is live. The [github repo](https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/pfmc_assessment_handbook) has directions for editing it moving forward.
- [Stock Synthesis](https://nmfs-stock-synthesis.github.io/doc/) is the modeling software. The User guide is key to your success!
- The [r4SS package](https://github.com/r4ss/r4ss) is a collection of R functions for creating plots and tables for Stock Synthesis model output


**Excellent resource for Git, R and the workflow**
- [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html)
- [Reproducible Research Course by Eric Anderson (SWFSC)](http://eriqande.github.io/rep-res-web/syllabus.html)

**Other GitHub repositories related to Stock Assessments**
The parent orgnization pfmc-assessments is the organization where repositories for related PFMC stock assessments tools live
